This is a recreation of the ZX Max Plus D Issue 1 PCB as designed by DonSuperfo but done in KiCAD 9.

!!! WARNING, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CREATE GERBERS FROM THESE FILES AS THE PCB TRACK AND VIA LAYOUT IS NOT COMPLETE OR CORRECT.!!!
!!! ONLY THE PCB COMPONENT LAYOUT AND SCHEMATIC IS CORRECT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL !!!

This was only done in order to create an interactive BOM (in the BOM folder) to assist in the assembling of the PCB.

The KiCAD schematics 'should' be correct but nothing should be assumed as correct without checking with the original schematic and PCB layout.

Use at your own risk.
